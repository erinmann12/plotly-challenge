***Background***

For this project, I was tasked with building an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

A small handful of microbial species (also referred to as operational taxonomic units or OTUs) were found to be present in over 70% of people, while the other species were relatively rare.
